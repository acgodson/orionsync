# ORIONSync

##Imagine working on a hackathon project with strangers!

OrionSync is a Multi-signature workspace for BuildLers to collaborate effectively on projects, and fairly distribute prizes/revenue

Hosting a built-in wallet that facilitates fund splitting among contributors and a video communication layer powered by Huddle01 and Polybase, OrionSync establishes a secure and transparent environment for new and existing teams to collaborate effectively.

Recording and other proof of history are securely stored on Filecoin using lighthouse storage, and event notifications are facilitated from both smart contract and web-client using PUSH protocol
